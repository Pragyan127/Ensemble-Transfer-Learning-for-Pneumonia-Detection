# 🫁 Ensemble Transfer Learning for Pneumonia Detection

This project implements an **ensemble deep learning model** combining **DenseNet121**, **MobileNet**, and **EfficientNet** for accurate and efficient pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images (CXR). The model is trained using **transfer learning** and achieves a **test accuracy of 99.24%**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory condition that demands quick and accurate diagnosis. This work leverages the strengths of three powerful deep learning architectures:

- **DenseNet121** – for efficient gradient flow and feature reuse  
- **MobileNetV3** – for lightweight, mobile-friendly performance  
- **EfficientNetV2S** – for accuracy with fewer parameters

These models are fine-tuned and fused into an **ensemble model** using weighted averaging.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Each model processes the input image independently. Their feature maps are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer for binary classification (Normal / Pneumonia).

### Training Configuration
- Loss Function: `Binary Crossentropy`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Learning Rate: `1e-4` with decay on plateau
- Batch Size: `16`
- Epochs: `Up to 28` (with EarlyStopping)
